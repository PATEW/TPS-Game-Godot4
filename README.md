# TPS-Game-Godot4

Currently making a third-person shooter game using the newly released Godot 4 Engine. Mostly just a test to get more experience with Godot, but I'll keep adding features until I get busy with other things. 

(Project code is private atm but I'm uploading gifs of gameplay and other stuff here as the game progresses.)
